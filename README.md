Working on [KFQuake, an enhanced fork of Kickflip Quake](https://github.com/Fluffacorn/KFQuake) and various other things related to [The 80s Zone](https://the80s.zone)

Don't intend to accept pull requests for KFQuake often unless it's really something cool, and will basically never accept optimaztion tweaks.

You can reach me at fluffacorn@the80s.zone if you really need to, I don't check any of my other accounts so it's the fastest way to get in contact.

If you know Michael "Squirt" BÃ¼ttner or `are` him, email me immediately. I'd love to get in contact with the lad.
