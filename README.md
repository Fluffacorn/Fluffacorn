Working on [KFQuake, an enhanced fork of Kickflip Quake](https://github.com/Fluffacorn/KFQuake) and various other things related to [The 80s Zone](https://the80s.zone)

You can reach me at fluffacorn@the80s.zone if you really need to, I don't check any of my other accounts so it's the fastest way to get in contact.

Thank you to Michael "Squirt" BÃ¼ttner for being so nice to me in email, and seemingly enjoying the mod I've made!
